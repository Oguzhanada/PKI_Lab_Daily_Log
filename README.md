# 🔐 PKI & Active Directory Lab — Daily Log

This repository documents my day-to-day progress while building and troubleshooting a **PowerShell-driven PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and Active Directory lab** using VMware Workstation.

The goal is to recreate enterprise-level scenarios (Domain Controller, Enterprise CA, and domain-joined clients), automate administrative tasks, and improve technical troubleshooting and documentation skills.
